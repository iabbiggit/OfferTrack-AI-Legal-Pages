use and privacy policies and We encourage parents and legal guardians to
monitor their children's Internet usage and instruct their children to never
provide information on other websites without their permission.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We do not sell the personal information of Consumers We
actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless We receive affirmative
authorization (the &quot;right to opt-in&quot;) from either the Consumer who is
between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less
than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to the sale of personal information
may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, You
