equity, and finance related job interviews. The Service includes access to
practice questions, mock interview simulations, response recording,
AI-generated feedback and scoring, and progress tracking tools.</p>

<h3>AI-Generated Content Disclaimer</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Service provides feedback, scoring, and other content
generated or assisted by artificial intelligence (AI). This content is intended
for informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered
professional advice, a guarantee of performance, or an accurate assessment of
job readiness.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While We strive to provide helpful and relevant insights,
AI-generated content may contain inaccuracies, omissions, or limitations. You
are solely responsible for how you interpret and apply the information
provided. We makes no warranties or representations regarding the accuracy,
reliability, or suitability of any AI-generated content and disclaim all
liability arising from reliance on such content.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>While We also strive to ensure that all AI-generated content
is appropriate, relevant, and constructive, automated systems may occasionally
generate content that is inaccurate, biased, inappropriate, or offensive. By
using the Service, you acknowledge that you may be exposed to such content and
agree to use your own judgment when interpreting or acting upon it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Company does not assume responsibility for any harm,
offence, or damages that may arise from AI-generated outputs. If you encounter
content that you believe is inappropriate or harmful, please contact us
immediately at admin@velotrixai.com so we can investigate and take appropriate
action.</p>

<h3>Usage Limits and Fair Use</h3>

depending on your subscription plan. These limits may include, but are not
limited to, restrictions on the number of:</p>

<ul>

any time, including based on system capacity, fair usage, or to prevent misuse.
Limits applicable to your plan will be communicated within the app or on our
website.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your subscription is personal to You and may not be shared,
transferred, or used by anyone other than You. Shared or unauthorised access —

performance data (such as saved responses, scores, and AI feedback), may only
be available to users with an active subscription. If your subscription expires
or is cancelled, you may lose access to some or all of this data.<b> </b>We may
retain your performance history and related personal data for a limited period
following the expiry of your subscription to enable future access should you
choose to reactivate your subscription. However, we do not guarantee the
availability or preservation of your data.<b> </b>It is your responsibility to
maintain your subscription if you wish to ensure ongoing access to your
historical data and progress tracking features.</p>

<h2>Subscriptions</h2>

<h3>Subscription period</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Service offers subscription-based access to certain
features and content. Subscriptions are managed and billed through the Apple
App Store or Google Play Store, depending on your device.</p>

charge your payment method on a recurring basis (e.g. monthly or annually),
according to the Subscription plan you select.</p>

automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless You cancel it or the
Company cancels it.</p>

<h3>Subscription cancellations, refunds and billing</h3>

handled by Apple or Google, not the Company. You can manage or cancel your
subscription at any time through your Apple or Google account settings. For
more information on billing or cancellation policies, please refer to:</p>

any change in Subscription fees to give You an opportunity to terminate Your
Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

change comes into effect constitutes Your agreement to pay the modified
Subscription fee amount.</p>

respective terms and conditions.</p>

order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>

right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii)
cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Any Promotions made available through the Service may be
governed by rules that are separate from these Terms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If You participate in any Promotions, please review the
applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for a Promotion
conflict with these Terms, the Promotion rules will apply.</p>

selected users (e.g. for testing, review, or marketing purposes). These codes
are intended for personal use by the recipient only, are non-transferable, and
may not be sold, shared, or publicly distributed without our prior written

time without notice, including in cases of misuse or breach of these Terms.</p>

provided by You or other users), features, software, functionality and other
intellectual property are and will remain the exclusive property of the Company

governed by a separate limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable
licence granted by the Company, as set out in these Terms.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Except as expressly permitted by applicable law or these
Terms, you may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, sublicense, reverse
engineer, or create derivative works based on any part of the Service without
our prior written permission.</p>

<h2>Your Suggestions to Us</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>You assign all rights, title and interest in any Suggestions
You provide the Company. If for any reason such assignment is ineffective, You

free, worldwide right and license to use, reproduce, disclose, sub-license,

<h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Our Service may contain links to third-party websites or

responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third
party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that the Company
shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or
loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or
reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any
such websites or services.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We strongly advise You to read the terms and conditions and
privacy policies of any third-party websites or services that You visit.</p>

<h2>Termination</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>We may terminate or suspend Your access immediately, without
prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without
limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease
immediately.</p>

<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire
liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this
Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to
the amount actually paid by You through the Service in the 12 months prior to
the claim or 10 USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no
event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental,
indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to,
damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business
interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way
related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software
and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection
with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been
advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its
essential purpose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties
or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means
that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's
liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>

<h2>&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and
&quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with all faults and defects without warranty of
any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on
its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective
licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether
express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service,
including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of
course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without
limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking,
and makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your
requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any
other software, applications, systems or services, operate without
interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or
that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any
of the company's providers makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Service, or
the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that
the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy,

Service; or (iv) that the Service, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent
from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses,
worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain
types of warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply
to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this
section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable
law.</p>

<h2>Governing Law</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>The laws of England and Wales, excluding its conflicts of
law rules, shall govern this Terms and Your use of the Service. Your use of the
Application may also be subject to other local, state, national, or
international laws.</p>

unaffected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If You are a European Union consumer, you will benefit from
any mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which You are resident.</p>

country that is subject to the United States government embargo, or that has
been designated by the United States government as a &quot;terrorist
supporting&quot; country, and (ii) You are not listed on any United States
government list of prohibited or restricted parties.</p>

<h2>Severability and Waiver</h2>

<h3>Severability</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable
or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the
objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable
law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>

<h3>Waiver</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right
or to require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not affect a
party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time
thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any
subsequent breach.</p>

<h2>Changes to these Terms and Conditions</h2>

replace these Terms at any time. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Your continued use of the Service following any changes

new Terms, you should stop using the Service.</p>

<h2>Force Majeure</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>We shall not be liable for any failure or delay in
performance of our obligations under these Terms where such failure or delay

terrorism, civil unrest, governmental action, labour disputes, failure or
interruption of utilities or telecommunications services, Internet or hosting
outages, or any similar events.</p>
